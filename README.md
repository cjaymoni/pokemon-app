# Pokemon Info App

A minimal pokemon-info app

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Approach

I used the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the pokemon data. I used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework and [TypeScript] (https://typescriptlang.org/) to build the app. I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. I used [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for data fetching.
For the search functionality, I used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing. I used [SweetAlert-2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for the loading spinner. I used [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/) as my icon repository and combined **React-useState** and **React-useContext** for state management.

## Features

- Search for pokemon by name
- View pokemon details
- View pokemon list
- 404 page

## Challenges

- I had to learn how to use the PokeAPI.
- I had to learn how vite works.

## Future Improvements

- Add some animations to the app
- Add more styling to the app
- Add Test cases to the app

## Deployment

The app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can view the app [here](https://pokemon-app-five-sigma.vercel.app/)
